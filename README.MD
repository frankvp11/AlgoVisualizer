Todo:
1. Write algorithms with visualization software provided by ModelMaker
2. Algorithms we need: 
   1. Depth of Binary Tree 
      1. Completed the animation
      2. Add description of how it works
      3. Fix the bug where a left and right node overlap
   2. Dijkstras
      1. Completed part of the animation
      2. "Change" the animation so that it goes slower, and more steps, considering each node individually
   3. Binary Search 
      1. Completed the animation
      2. Add description of how it works, examples, etc
   4. Some form of sort (perhaps merge/quick)
   5. Hashing
   6. Disjoint Set unions
   7. Depth first search
      1. Completed main animation
      2. Add explanation
   8. Breadth first search
      1. Completed main animation
      2. Add explanation
   9.  Fast exponentation
       1.  Show the tree diagram, and some small animation of the numbers in circles moving together, being multiplied and moving up
   10. ANN
       1.  https://brilliant.org/wiki/artificial-neural-network/#model-desiderata   
   11. Heaps
       1.  https://brilliant.org/wiki/heaps/#:~:text=Heaps%20are%20tree-based%20data,implementing%20priority%20queues%2C%20and%20more

3. Bug Fixes:
   1. Fix the tree drawing -> figure out how Matthew did it in 1XD3
