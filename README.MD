Todo:
1. Write algorithms with visualization software provided by ModelMaker
2. Algorithms we need: 
   1. Depth of Binary Tree 
      1. Completed the animation
      2. Add description of how it works
      3. Fix the bug where a left and right node overlap
   2. Dijkstras
   3. Binary Search 
      1. Completed the animation
      2. Add description of how it works, examples, etc
   4. Some form of sort (perhaps merge/quick)
   5. Hashing
   6. Disjoint Set unions
   7. Depth first search
   8. Breadth first search
   9.  Fast exponentation
