Todo:
1. Work on Main UI - decide on if we want to do a sidebar way of choosing which animation to go to or using cards on the center screen (rn I like the cards idea better)
2. Write algorithms with visualization software provided by ModelMaker
3. Algorithms we need: 
   1. Depth of Binary Tree
   2. Dijkstras
   3. Binary Search
   4. Some form of sort (perhaps merge/quick)
   5. Hashing
   6. Disjoint Set unions
   7. Depth first search
   8. Breadth first search
   9. Fast exponentation
